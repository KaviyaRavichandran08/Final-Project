## Final Project - Financial KPI Analysis for a Startup

## About This Project:

As part of my internship at Elevate Labs, I chose this project to explore how early-stage startups manage their financial performance. I created an interactive dashboard using **Power BI** to analyze:

- Revenue & Profit
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)
- LTV:CAC Ratio
- Burn Rate
- Customer Base by Location

My goal was to turn raw financial data into something easy to understand and useful for business decisions.

## Tools I Used:

- **Excel** – for cleaning and preparing the data  
- **Power BI** – for creating the dashboard and visual insights  

## Dashboard Highlights:

- KPI Cards showing total revenue, profit, and customer count  
- LTV:CAC Ratio Trend (line chart)  
- Customer location (donut chart)  
- Net Profit vs Total Expenses (bar chart)  
- CAC vs LTV by region  
- Admin Cost Contribution (pie chart)  
- Slicers for filtering by location and burn rate

## What I Learned:

- How to calculate and compare key financial metrics like LTV and CAC  
- How to build and design dashboards that are both informative and clean  
- How to present insights clearly using Power BI tools
